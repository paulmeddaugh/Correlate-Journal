# ThoughtWeb
The world is observed though our mind's eyes, often making thoughts and revelations critical impactors of our daily and overall lives. A simple pen and notebook are often picked up to keep track of or realize thoughts in a journal, typically only organized by date, but the ideas that shape our worlds don't always occur so linearly. Therefore, this website allows thoughts and journal entries to additionally be organized by idea through freely adding connections to any number of other entries. The site then presents each entry chronologically with the notes connected around them, and further sorts using notebooks and 'Main' or 'Sticky' note types. This site can also excel at brainstorming, or providing an overview of thoughts to figure out problems. It uses a React.js-Bootstrap frontend with a Java Spring Boot and MySQL database backend, and runs the React generated static build on the Spring server. 

## Algorithm Efficiency
This application relies primarily on binary insertion and search in a number of lists to, of course, often land O(log n) time complexity, but in the case of the editor, whose list also handles new and unsaved new notes, any connected note's real-time data must be retrieved; the algorithm used determines new unsaved notes in O(1), new saved notes in O(m), where m is the number of all newly created notes, and O(log loading-n), where n is the initial loaded list size. This algorithm is found in [Editor.js](react-frontend/src/components/Editor/Editor.js) around line 330.
