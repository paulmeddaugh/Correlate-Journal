# ThoughtWeb
The world can only be observed though our mind's eyes, often making thoughts and revelations critical impactors of our daily and overall lives. A simple pen and notebook are often picked up to keep track of or realize thoughts in a journal, typically only organized by the date, but the ideas that shape our worlds don't always occur so linearly. Therefore, this website allows thoughts and journal entries to additionally be organized by idea through the ability to freely connect entries to any number of others. The site then presents each entry chronologically with their connections around them, and further sorting using notebooks and 'Main' or 'Sticky' note types. This site can also excel at brainstorming, or providing an overview of thoughts to figure out problems. It uses a React.js-Bootstrap frontend with a Java Spring Boot to MySQL database backend, and runs the React generated static build on the Spring server.
