# ThoughtWeb
The colors of the world typically reveal themselves through our mind's eyes, often making revelations and thoughts some of the biggest influencers of our daily lives. Some address this by recognizing or recording thoughts in a journal, typically only organized by the date, but the ideas that shape our worlds don't always occur so linearly. Therefore, this website allows journal entries to also be organized by the paradigm shifts recognized in the daily entries through the ability to connect them to any other entry. The site then presents the notes in a manner similar to how a detective might connect his notes so the present perspective can be more easily understood.
